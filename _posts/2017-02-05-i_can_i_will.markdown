Wrong undergraduate degree. No time to learn something new. Too old to start all over again. So many excuses over the years as to why I could never become a software developer. And yet, I knew deep inside that I wanted to learn, that I could do it. After all, how many times have I taught myself to do something seemingly impossible? 

I studied political science in college. But to secure a part-time job writing computer manuals for a large management consulting firm, I learned everything I could about computer information systems. I was hired after graduation in the firm's high-tech lab. It was this role that launched my career in the technology industry. Shortly thereafter, and through hard work and determination, I was able to secure a job not typically available to graduates outside the Ivy League: a role in corporate finance at a prestigious technology investment bank. I was fortunate to participate in one of the most exciting eras in the technology industry (the Internet boom). 

Dedicated to my career, I worked long days, nights and weekends throughout my 20s and mid-30s and rapidly advanced in my career. But after a few years following the birth of my first child, I did the unthinkable. I took time off of my career to raise my kids. And now -- a single mom in my late 40s, I struggle to find meaningful work in my small resort town of Santa Barbara. Worse, I fear, my age keeps recruiters from even considering my credentials. 

I am currently a wealth advisor starting over at a large wirehouse firm. Despite the odds, I was able to quickly secure my series 7, 63, and 65 licenses while working full-time and raising two children full-time. Despite the investment of time already made to build my practice, I know that this is not where I want to be long-term. 

So, here I am... finally taking the plunge. I am going to become a software developer. I know that my newfound skills will help me to realize my true calling. One day, I look forward to building my own applications that will positively impact the world. I have quite a few ideas! I am excited about the opportunity to learn... and, once again, prove that anything is possible when you set your mind to it!
